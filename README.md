### 1. Scenario & Additional Elements
**Scenario:** Third-Person Game (Theme: Vehicle Zombie Survival)

**Rationale:** We are using the Unreal Third-Person template but replacing the character with a car to create a survival driving game.

**The Four Additional Elements:**
* **Vehicle Physics & Combat:** Using the car as a weapon to run over zombies (and taking damage from them).
* **Horde AI Logic:** Simple AI that makes zombies swarm toward the player's position.
* **Resource/Pickup System:** Collecting fuel or repair kits to keep the run going.
* **Win/Loss State UI:** "Car Destroyed" screen (Loss)\ A zombies killed count until all zombies killed or a survival timer (Win)

### 2. Brainstorming on Content (Assets)
We brainstormed the specific assets needed to make that scenario work:
* **Art:** Vehicle model, Zombie character model, City/Highway environment assets (roads, barriers), UI elements (Health bar, Fuel gauge).
* **Audio:** Engine revving, impact sounds (hitting zombies), background ambient track, game over sound effects.
* **Code:** Vehicle controller script, Enemy navigation (NavMesh), Game Loop Manager (Spawn logic, Win/Loss conditions).
